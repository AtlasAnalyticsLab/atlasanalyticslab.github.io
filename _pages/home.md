The Atlas Analytics Lab conducts research across computer vision, deep learning, optimization, and natural language processing, with a strong application focus in digital and computational pathology. -->

# **Atlas Analytics Lab**
---
Our lab primarily develops new deep learning and computer vision methods, with computational pathology serving as a key domain for grounding, validation, and downstream impact. Our research focuses on:
  - **Deep Learning**: Representation Learning and Engineering, Efficient Training, Optimization
  - **Computer Vision**: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Hardware-Aware Architecture Design
  - **Computational Pathology (application domain)**: Foundation Modeling, Vision-Language Modeling (VLM), Diagnostic Pathology, Diffusion Generative Modeling, Cancer Biomarker Discovery


### About us
The Atlas Analytics Lab operates within [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/)’s [Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering (CSSE)](https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/computer-science-software-eng.html) and is directed by Dr. Mahdi S. Hosseini, [Gina Cody Research Chair](https://www.concordia.ca/faculty/mahdi-hosseini.html), Adjunct Professor in Pathology at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/pathology/dr-mahdi-hosseini), and Affiliate Member of [Mila – Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/directory/mahdi-hosseini).
We maintain strong collaborations with clinical partners such as [CHUM](https://www.chumontreal.qc.ca/) and [Sunnybrook Hospital](https://sunnybrook.ca/) to develop clinically driven AI solutions.

 **Opportunities are available for PhD students to join our expanding team.** [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/openings) **!**


### Our support
Our work is supported by major federal, provincial, and institutional funding sources, including Concordia University, NSERC, the Fonds de recherche du Québec, the Canada Foundation for Innovation, IRICoR, the Digital Research Alliance of Canada, and the Amazon Research Award.
